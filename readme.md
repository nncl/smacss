# SMACSS

Just training with [this awesome class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6co781JgoqQ&spfreload=5).

It has 5 categories, and you will see right now.

## Base
Define how an element should look like anywhere on the page, they are the default elements.

## Layout
Divide the page into sections, MAJOR sections, not like the navigation or maybe the sidebar sections, the MAJOR ones only

And it will hold MULTIPLES modules together

You can add module classes as well if you have to append them into another
modules classes.

## Modules
Reusable little bits of SMACSS where you can turn around everywhere

For example nav, tag and card
    
## State
Defines a way to describe how a module look in a state
Rules from this category are the only ones that can maybe use !important
